=Roborunner-GUI=
RoboRunner-GUI is a multi-threaded / multi-process Robocode battle runner.

Installation overview:
  * Unzip to a new directory, e.g. ~/roborunner
  * Run setup.sh to clone an existing Robocode install. (Each thread
    uses its own install.)

WARNING: This is a ALPHA version of RoboRunner-GUI. This version does not
	save the queue or battle results! Please report any bugs.

=Requirements=
RoboRunner-GUI depends on Guava, Google's core libraries for Java, which you
can grab here: http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/
If you downloaded a RoboRunner binary installation, there's a Guava
JAR already included.

You'll also need Robocode, of course: http://robocode.sourceforge.net/

Happy Robocoding!
